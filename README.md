# Mindflow: A VR + BCI Meditation App 
https://devpost.com/software/mindflow-s5itbj?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects

## What it does
We receive the brain signals of the user using Arctop’s Neuos SDK and the BCI headband. The user uses an Oculus Quest 2 to immerse themselves in a meditation session. At the same time, Neuos reads the user’s brain signals for Focus and Enjoyment which allow us to personalize their meditation experience in real-time.

## How we built it
We started with getting Arctop’s Neuos SDK configured and working. We use two kinds of data from the brain signals—focus and enjoyment. This data is used to alter the brightness and the number of stars that appear in the meditation activity. The brightness of the stars is modified by the amount of focus and the number of stars is modified by the amount of enjoyment. After a guided meditation breathing exercise using a bubble, the user is led to a horizon view where they can visualize the stars.
